# Data_Analysis_Clustering
Thanks a lot to the original resource: https://realpython.com/k-means-clustering-python/
I added my understanding and code to have a better understanding, if you find this one interesting, I would like to recommand you also check the link.
Clustering_Kmeans.ipynb contains all the basic K-means clustering info.
Clustering_Kmeans_NCluster.ipynb tells how to choose right number of clusters.
Clustering_Kmeans_Advanced.ipynb have the approaches to evaluate the clustering results.
Clustering_Kmeans_pipe.ipynb is the most advanced part, tells how to build and tune pipelines.
